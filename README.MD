## Figura avatars

Files of avatars for the [Figura mod](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura) for Minecraft: Java Edition.

Do not claim these as your own! If you distribute them, do not remove my name from the `avatar.json`'s authors. You are free to modify them otherwise.

The one for [Curin](Curin) is just a few addons, as the rest of her skin comes from the vanilla player model. It adds:
- Pigtails using [ChloeSpacedOut's PhysBoneAPI](https://github.com/ChloeSpacedOut/figura-physbone-api).
- Octane follower from Rocket League.
- Fumo-styled Curin replacement model for the player skull.
- A soft-drink can inside your head?
